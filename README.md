## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid for layout
- CSS and Tailwind CSS for styling

### What I Learned

This project helped me improve my skills in working with grids and CSS layout techniques. I practiced building responsive grid layouts, handling different screen sizes, and adjusting the grid structure in media queries. Working with CSS Grid also helped me understand the flexibility of two-dimensional layouts for creating complex designs with ease.

### Continued Development

I aim to further develop my CSS Grid skills to design more intricate layouts and enhance my understanding of responsive web design. Additionally, I'll continue to explore styling components with various approaches to keep the design adaptable across different devices.

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs on CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - A great reference for quickly checking grid properties and functions.
